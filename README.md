# what-i-learned-week-11
It's *only* been 12 weeks!
___

1. Object Methods- Some object properties can serve as object methods. These methods contain functions that can affect the object itself.

2. forEach- Runs the specified function on every element in the array

3. Filter- Makes a new array, but does not include the values from the original array that don't meet a true/false statement(ex. for words greater than 5 characters)

4. Map- Creates a new array with the result of calling a function on each element. (ex. The cow becomes the burger and the chicken becomes a nugget.)
